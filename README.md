# upnvj-el-programming
This repository is used for learning programming algorithms for the UPNVJ Electrical Engineering Major.

All instruction, program code (including variable name), etc is preferaby written in english, unless it is an example from module (it's just a copy paste from module so you can run it in code editor).

### Folder structure
each folder is named according to the week in which the module was worked on. Week one has another folder separated by unit because they have `.c` and `.exe` file, week 2 - week 5 only have `.ipynb` file for each unit.

### Disclaimer for ipynb
⚠️Every `.ipynb	` is worked (executed) in google colab, you may need adjustment if you execute it in local.
